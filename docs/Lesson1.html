                            <h1>Lesson 1 : Type of Pain</h1>
                            <p>The feeling of pain is caused by electrical signals that passbetween your nerves, spinal cord, and brain. Nerves under your skin convert the sensations you feel into an electrical signal. That signal then travels through your
                                spinal cord to your brain. Your brain then interprets the signal as painful. There are different types of pain, depending on the cause. Everyone also feels pain in different ways. You can also experience more than one type
                                of pain at a time. Understanding the different types of pain is important. Some people think that opioid medicines should be used to treat all types of pain. But some treatments work better with one type of pain than another.
                                Understanding the different types of pain can help you use your opioid medicines more safely.</p>

                                <p>It is caused by triggeringpain receptors(known as nociceptors).You have these types of pain receptors throughout your body. They are widespreadin your skin and in yourorgans. When theyare triggered, such as through a cut
                                    or other injury, they sendelectrical signals from the site, through your spinal cord and to your brain. Your brain interprets the electrical signal as the feeling ofpain.There are two main types of nociceptive pain:
                                    visceral and somatic.</p>
