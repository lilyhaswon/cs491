											<h1>Lesson 5 : Drugs that Should Never be Mixed with Opioids</h1>
                                            <p>The number of opioid overdose deaths has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, more than 75,000 people had drug overdoses related to opioid medicines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that prescription opioid medicines are involved in at least 40% of opioid overdose deaths.Taking opioids by themselves can be dangerous if they are taken in large doses.Taking other drugs that affect pain receptorscan increasethe effects of opioid drugs, even if you don’t realize it. This added effect can make an overdose even more likely.It’s important to know about the ways that drugs caninteract.</p>
                                            <p>Opioids have a particularly dangerous reaction with prescription drugs called benzodiazepines, or “benzos” for short. Benzos are used to treat anxiety and insomnia. Examples of benzos include alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, clobazam, lorazepam, or chlordiazepoxide. Both opioids and benzos can make you feel sleepy and can slow your breathing. Because they have these similar effects, taking opioids and benzos together is especially dangerous. It is like taking a double dose of medicineand you are more likely to overdose or die.</p>
                                            <p>Alcohol is another drug that's dangerous to mix with opioids. At high levels, alcohol is a depressant. That means it also acts to slow down your breathing and can make you sleepy. Drinking alcohol when you are taking opioids or benzos also increases the risk of an overdose or death.Other types of drugs that can act as depressants, include muscle relaxants, antipsychotic drugs, sleep medicines, and even antihistamines (drugs like Benadryl, that treat allergies).</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Drugs that have serotonin can also be dangerous to take with opioids. Some example of these drugs are antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram), drugs to treat migraine headaches (e.g. sumatriptan), and St. John's wort. When you take these drugs with opioids, serotonin can build up in your body. When serotonin builds up to dangerous levels, it is called serotonin syndrome. This build up can cause very high blood pressure and can increase your heart rate. There is a risk of death from serotonin syndrome.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There may be good reasons why you need to take these groups of medicines together. But you should only take the drugs your providerprescribes and in the doses that they prescribe for you. </p>
