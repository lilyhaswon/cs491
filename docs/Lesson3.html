											<h1>Lesson 3 : Emotions and Pain</h1>
                                            <p>Many people who have chronic pain may have been told, “It’s all in your head.” It is true that our brains tell us when something feels painful. But this does not mean that your feelings of pain are not real. The parts of the brain that process sensations as painful or not are close to the parts of the brain that control our feelings. That is one reason why we may feel pain even if there doesn’t seem to be a reason for it (for example, physical pain we feel related to emotional distress).The brain may also store the pain in long-term memory. In that way, pain from an injury can continue long after the injury healed.</p>
                                            <p>Negative emotions and pain can act in a cycle. Negative feelings, like distress and depression, can cause us to feel pain. Chronic pain can also make us feel frustrated and depressed. People who feel chronic pain may also avoid exercising or spending time with others. This can make painfeel worse. For some types of pain, exercise can actually help treat the pain. In some cases, distraction (that is, taking our minds off our pain) may helppain feel better. Limiting our activities can make us feel sad or distressed, which can make our pain feel worse. Pain and negative emotions become like a “vicious cycle.”</p>
                                            <p>There are different ways that we can use our mind and emotions to deal with pain. A pain therapistcan help youdeal with the negative feelings you have about your pain. Practicing meditation may also help. Meditation can help you relax both your mind and your body. Using these approaches does not necessarily mean that the pain will go away. But reducing your feelings of distress and relaxing may help lessen the pain. It is a way to break the “vicious cycle.”</p>

                                                        Question 2: True - negative emotions can cause us to avoid exercising or seeing friends and family. Some types of pain improve with exercise and distraction. 
                                                        <br> Question 3: True - a person with chronic pain can start to feel frustrated or depressed when their pain is not managed well.
                                                        <br> Question 4:  False - there is no guarantee that a therapist can make the pain go away, but addressing our feelings about pain may help less it. <br> Question 5:  True-meditation helps by relaxing our mind and body and helps break the “vicious cycle” of pain and emotional distress.</p>
