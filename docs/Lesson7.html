											<h1>Lesson 7 : Safe Opioid Use</h1>
                                            <p>People who take opioids are at risk for opioid dependence,addiction, and overdose. Dependence is when you start to experience withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking a drug. Addiction is when a person becomes so preoccupied with getting a drug that it starts to interfere with their daily life. Overdose is a life-threatening situation that can happen when you take too much of a drug.The risks for these problems increase when opioids are misused. Misuse means you are not taking the medicines the wayyour providertold you to, you are using them to get high, or you are taking someone else's opioids.</p>
                                            <p>You may not need to take opioid medicines to treat your pain. There may also be things your provider needs to know before they prescribe you an opioid medicine. It is important that you have an open conversation with your provide before you start taking an opioid medicine. Here are some of the things you should discusswith your provider:</p>
                                            <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                                                - Whether there are alternativesthat might treat your pain<br>
                                                - The risks and benefits of taking opioids<br>
                                                - Your medical history and if you or anyone in your family has a history of substance misuse or addiction to drugs or alcohol<br>
                                                - Any other medicines and supplements you are taking<br>
                                                - How much alcohol you drink<br>
                                                - If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant <br>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                If you and your provider decide that you need to take opioids, be sure you understand how to take them safely. You should be sure you talk to your provider so that you understand:
                                            </p>
                                            <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                                                - How to take the medicine<br>
                                                - how much and how often <br>
                                                - How long you will need to take the medicine <br>
                                                - What the possible side effects are <br>
                                                - How you should stop the medicines when you no longer need them. If you have been taking opioids for a while, it can be dangerous to just stop suddenly. You may need to get off the medicines slowly.<br>
