											<h1>Lesson 6: Non-opioid Alternatives for Pain Management</h1>
                                            <p>Nearly everyone has dealt with some level of pain at some time or another.Opioids are often prescribed to treat pain. Opioids can be good at treating acute (sudden and short-term) pain. But opioids arealso highly addictiveand can be dangerous.Opioids were never meantto be used for long-term pain relief. They work best when they are used for a short timeand only to treat severe pain.There are many other treatments available that are may be justas effective as opioids for relieving and managing pain.But everyone responds differently and certain alternatives only work well for specific types of pain. You shouldtalk to your providerto see if any of these options might work for you.</p>
