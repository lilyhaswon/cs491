											<h1>Lesson 9 : Safe Opioid Disposal</h1>
                                            <p>If you have unused opioid medicines at the end of your treatment, you should dispose of them safely. You should not keep any remaining pills either for your own use or to give to other people. There are three ways to safely dispose of unused opioid medicines. Follow these recommendations, in order, if you have left over pills</p>
                                            <p><b>Take unused pills to a drug take-back location.</b> Many pharmacies and police stations have drug take-back programs. You can drop off or mail in unused medicines at secured locations. To find a disposal site near you, go to <a>https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubdispsearch/spring/main?execution=e1s1.</a></p>
                                            <p>If there is no drug take-back program in your area, you <b>may</b> be able to <b>flush unused pills or patches down the toilet</b>. Opioids are among aselect set of drugs that can befatal with just one dose if they are not used as prescribed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that expired, unwanted, or otherwise unused portions of these drugs maybe flushed down the sink or toilet. Check the FDA’s list of drugs to be sure that you can safely flush your unused medicines down the toilet (<a>https://www.fda.gov/drugs/disposal-unused-medicines-what-you-should-know/drug-disposal-fdas-flush-list-certain-medicines</a>). Before flushing patches, fold them in half so the sticky sides are together.</p>
                                            <p>If there is no drug take-back program and it is not safe to flush your pills, follow these steps to <b>dispose of medicines in the household trash:</b></p>
                                            <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                                                - Step 1. Mix medicines (do <b>NOT</b> crush tablets or capsules) with water and something inedible, such as kitty litter, dirt, or used coffee grounds. This will keep others from finding and using the opioids. Before disposing a pain patch, fold it in half so the sticky sides are together.<br><br>
                                                - Step 2: Place the mixture in a container such as a plastic bag and seal it with duct tape.<br><br>
                                                - Step 3: Place this container inside a second, unmarked container. <br><br>
                                                - Step 4: Throw the container in your household trash. <br><br>
                                                - Step 5: Before throwing out your empty pill bottle or other empty medicine packaging, remember to scratch out all information on the label to make it unreadable. This helps to ensure that no one uses the prescription information on the bottle to try to get refills.<br>
