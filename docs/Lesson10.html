											<h1>Lesson 10 : Signs of Opioid Overuse or Overdose</h1>
                                            <p>Anyone using opioids is at risk of overmedicine or overdose if they take too much. You are much more at risk of overmedicine or overdose if you have never taken opioids. Someone who has never taken an opioid may experience stronger effects of the drugs and worse side effects of opioids because their bodies are not used to them.</p>
                                            <p><b>Some signs of overmedicine include:</b></p>

												<h3>Naloxone (brand name: Narcan) is a medicine that blocks the effects of opioids.</h3>
												<p style="margin-left: 40px">It quickly reverses the breathing problems that result from an opioid overdose. Naloxone can be given as a nasal spray or by injection to a person who has overdosed. Naloxone is available in most U.S. states without a prescription. Providers may also prescribe it along with an opioid medicine. You can get it at your local pharmacy. Family and friends of people taking opioids are encouraged to have naloxone at home so it can be given in the case of a suspected overdose. If naloxone is available, administer it. However, it is important to understand that the reversal of an opioid overdose with naloxone may only be temporary. The person who has overdosed will still need medical attention.</p>

												<p style="margin-left: 40px">Anyone suspected of taking an overdose of opioids should see a medical provider right away. This is true even if the overdose may have been accidental. A health professional can diagnose opioid use disorder (misusing opioids) and opioid addiction. Opioid addiction is a chronic illness and should be treated the same as other chronic illnesses. Treatment for opioid addiction is different for each person.</p>

												<p style="margin-left: 40px">The main goal of treatment is to help you stop using the drug. Treatment also can help you avoid using it again in the future. When you stop using opioids, your body will react. You will have a number of symptoms that may include nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, and anxiety. This reaction is called withdrawal. Your healthcare provider can prescribe certain medicines to help relieve your withdrawal symptoms. They also will help control your cravings.</p>
