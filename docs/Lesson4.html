											<h1>Lesson 4 : What are Opioids?</h1>
                                            <p>Opioids are a broad group of pain-relieving drugs. They work by targeting pain receptorsin your cells.Opioids are either made from the poppy plant or are man-made in a lab.The illegal drug, heroin, is also an opioid. Man-made opioids are also known as “synthetic opioids.” These man-made opioids can be especially dangerous because people making them may add in otherdangerous ingredients. When you take an opioid medicine, the medicinetravels to through your blood and into your brain, gut, and spine. In these areas, the medicineattaches to opioid receptors. This attachment releases chemicals that muffle your feelings of pain. They also boost yourfeelings of pleasure.</p>
                                            <p>While opioids are good at treating pain, they can also be dangerous. At proper doses, opioids treat pain but can also make you feel sleepy. At these lower doses, and with proper use, there is less risk for negative effects or addiction. A person can become addicted to opioids due to the pleasant feelings they can give. A person may end up taking too high a dose trying to achieve the pleasant effects. At high doses, opioids can slow your breathing and heart rate so much that you could die. If a person has overdosed, they won't respond when shaken or called. Their breathing will be slow (or they may not be breathing at all). Their lips may turn blue. They may also make a snoring or gurgling sound in their throat. If a person has any of these symptoms, someone should call 911. There are drugs that can reverse an opioid overdose. Some examples are naloxone and Narcan. Many providers will prescribe one of these reversal drugs along with an opioid prescription.</p>
                                            <p>You can reduce your risk of dangerous side effects by following your provider's instructions carefully and taking your medicineexactly as prescribed. Opioids work well for severe pain but are not the best medicinefor every type of pain. You may have prescriptions for other types of pain medicines besides your opioid medicine. For example, neuropathic pain usually responds better to medicines like gabapentin. Make sure your providerknows all of the other medicines and supplements you're taking.Be sure you understand how you should take your opioid medicine. Questions to ask your providerinclude the following:</p>
                                            <p>
                                                What pain is this opioid prescribed to treat?<br>
                                                Should my pain go away completely with this opioid?<br>
                                                How long is it safe to take this opioid?<br>
                                                What warning signs should I look for while taking this opioid?<br>
                                                What should I do if I accidentally take too much of this opioid?<br>
                                                Do I need to get an opioid reversal drug (e.g., naloxone or Narcan)? If so, where can I get it?<br>
